# GPU Glossary Interactive Web App - Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Step 1: Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite project with complete tooling setup
Starting: Setting up React project with TypeScript, Vite, ESLint, Prettier, and styled-components
âœ… COMPLETED: React + TypeScript project created with all dependencies and tooling configured

### Step 2: Convert GPU glossary data from memory.md to structured JSON format
Starting: Creating structured data files for all GPU concepts, categories, and relationships
âœ… COMPLETED: Created structured TypeScript data files with 42 detailed GPU concepts, categories, and learning paths

### Step 3: Build core React components and theme system
Starting: Creating reusable UI components, theme system, and basic layout structure
âœ… COMPLETED: Built complete React app with theme system, routing, core components, and all pages

### Step 4: Add interactive visualizations and enhance content presentation
Starting: Creating interactive GPU architecture diagrams, syntax highlighting, and rich content features
âœ… COMPLETED: Added 3 interactive visualizations (GPU Architecture, Memory Hierarchy, Thread Hierarchy) with D3.js and Framer Motion

### Step 5: Add final polish and optimizations
Starting: Performance optimizations, mobile responsiveness checks, and final UI polish
âœ… COMPLETED: Added loading components, component indexes, comprehensive README, and final optimizations
