1) saw this sick GPU glossary from Modal Labs here https://github.com/modal-labs/gpu-glossary
2) replaced "hub" with "ingest" -> https://gitingest.com/modal-labs/gpu-glossary
3) downloaded .txt file of the entire glossary, saved into a directory
4) claude
5) "you are tasked with reading all of the detailed text information about GPUs inside the txt file @modal-labs-gpu-glossary.txt . you must create a cohesive, end to end educational interactive web-app book over the entire glossary. every concept, piece by piece. you will store your memory in a memory.md file, your tasks in a plan.md file, all of these instructions must be remembered in your claude.md all before you begin. lets create this web. keep a document called progress.txt (remember this in CLAUDE.md) that will first say what you are doing, then when you are done, you have to put a checkmark indicating you are done. after each checkmark you will put the next step to implement unless there is no more. when you think you are done you refer to this progress.txt to ensure you are fully done. do not end until you fully create this interactive educational web application end to end. think carefully, take a deep breath, and take your time."
6) ~$4 of development later
